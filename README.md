The animation visualizes the process of translating assembly code into binary machine code. Each assembly instruction is shown moving towards an "assembler" box. Inside the box, the instruction is processed and converted into binary format. The binary code is then displayed as it exits the box. This sequence illustrates how assembly code is transformed into machine-readable binary instructions.
